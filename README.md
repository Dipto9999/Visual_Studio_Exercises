## Overview

This repository contains solutions to **C** programming exercises in the **Visual Studio 2019 IDE**.

These **Visual Studio** projects were originally completed as lab exercises for <b>CPSC 259 - Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineers</b>, which is a course at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>.

## Modifications

However, these projects were modified to deviate from the original submissions. In their current form, they are largely a personal exploration of the **C/C++** language features in the **Visual Studio IDE**.

## Unit Test

In order to verify the functionality of these **C** programs, I developed unit test files in **C++**. This involved extensive coverage of the edge cases of each function tested.

## Policy

I have read and understood the plagiarism policies at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cheat.html and I understand that no excuse for plagiarism will be accepted.
