## Overview

This repository contains solutions to **C** programming exercises in the **Visual Studio 2019 IDE**.

### Projects

* [DNA Analyzer](DNA_Analyzer)
* [Airplane Linked List](Airplane_Linked_List)
* [Maze Solver](Maze_Solver)

## Modifications

These **Visual Studio** projects were originally completed as lab exercises for <b>CPSC 259 - Data Structures and Algorithms for Electrical Engineers</b>, which is a course at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>. However, these projects were modified to deviate from the original submissions. In their current form, they are largely a personal exploration of the **C/C++** language features in the **Visual Studio IDE**.

### Unit Tests

In order to verify the functionality of these **C** programs, I developed unit test files in **C++**. This involved extensive coverage of the edge cases of each function tested.
